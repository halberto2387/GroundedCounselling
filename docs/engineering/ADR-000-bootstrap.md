# ADR-000: Technology Stack and Architecture Bootstrap

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We need to establish the foundational technology stack and architecture for GroundedCounselling, a mental health platform that connects clients with licensed counsellors. The platform must be:

- **Secure and Compliant**: HIPAA-ready with audit logging and encryption
- **Scalable**: Support growing user base and feature set
- **Developer-Friendly**: Modern tooling with good developer experience
- **Production-Ready**: Robust CI/CD, monitoring, and deployment pipeline
- **Cost-Effective**: Reasonable infrastructure and maintenance costs

## Decision

### Frontend Stack: Next.js + React
**Chosen**: Next.js 14 with App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui

**Rationale**:
- **Next.js 14**: Latest version with App Router provides excellent developer experience, built-in optimization, and strong TypeScript support
- **React**: Industry standard with excellent ecosystem and developer familiarity
- **TypeScript**: Type safety critical for healthcare applications
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS for rapid, consistent UI development
- **shadcn/ui**: High-quality, accessible components that can be customized with our branding

**Alternatives Considered**:
- **Vue.js + Nuxt**: Good option but React ecosystem better for our team
- **SvelteKit**: Smaller bundle sizes but smaller ecosystem
- **Angular**: More opinionated, heavier learning curve

### Backend Stack: FastAPI + Python
**Chosen**: FastAPI, Python 3.11+, async SQLAlchemy 2.0, Pydantic v2

**Rationale**:
- **FastAPI**: Excellent performance, automatic OpenAPI docs, great async support
- **Python**: Strong ecosystem for data processing, AI/ML future features
- **async SQLAlchemy 2.0**: Modern async ORM with excellent performance
- **Pydantic v2**: Type-safe data validation and serialization

**Alternatives Considered**:
- **Node.js + Express**: JavaScript everywhere but Python better for our domain
- **Django**: Great but overkill for API-first architecture
- **Go**: Excellent performance but smaller ecosystem for healthcare

### Database: PostgreSQL
**Chosen**: PostgreSQL 15+

**Rationale**:
- **ACID Compliance**: Critical for healthcare data integrity
- **JSON Support**: Flexible schema for varying data structures
- **Extensions**: Rich ecosystem (UUID, full-text search, etc.)
- **Proven at Scale**: Battle-tested in healthcare applications

**Alternatives Considered**:
- **MySQL**: Good but PostgreSQL superior for complex queries
- **MongoDB**: Document flexibility but ACID properties less robust

### Caching & Queue: Redis
**Chosen**: Redis 7+ for caching and job queues

**Rationale**:
- **Dual Purpose**: Both cache and message broker
- **Performance**: Excellent for session management and real-time features
- **RQ Integration**: Simple job queue implementation with Redis

**Alternatives Considered**:
- **Memcached**: Cache-only, would need separate queue solution
- **RabbitMQ**: Excellent but Redis simpler for our needs

### Background Jobs: RQ (Redis Queue)
**Chosen**: RQ with Redis

**Rationale**:
- **Simplicity**: Easier to setup and manage than Celery
- **Python Native**: Pure Python, excellent debugging
- **Redis Integration**: Leverages existing Redis infrastructure

**Alternatives Considered**:
- **Celery**: More features but complex setup
- **Dramatiq**: Good alternative but smaller community

### Authentication: JWT with Refresh Tokens
**Chosen**: JWT access tokens (15 min) + refresh tokens (7 days)

**Rationale**:
- **Stateless**: Scales well across multiple servers
- **Security**: Short-lived access tokens with secure refresh mechanism
- **Healthcare Standard**: Common pattern in healthcare applications

**Alternatives Considered**:
- **Session-based**: Simpler but requires server-side storage
- **OAuth2 only**: External dependency for simple use case

### Video Conferencing: Jitsi Meet
**Chosen**: Jitsi Meet with iframe integration

**Rationale**:
- **HIPAA-Ready**: Can be configured for healthcare compliance
- **Self-Hosted Option**: Can host own instance if needed
- **No API Limits**: Unlike Zoom, no per-minute charges
- **Easy Integration**: Simple iframe embedding

**Alternatives Considered**:
- **Zoom**: Excellent quality but expensive and complex integration
- **WebRTC Direct**: Maximum control but significant development effort
- **Twilio Video**: Good but ongoing per-minute costs

### Deployment Strategy
**Chosen**: 
- **Frontend**: Vercel
- **Backend**: Render
- **Database**: Neon (PostgreSQL)
- **Cache**: Upstash (Redis)

**Rationale**:
- **Vercel**: Excellent Next.js integration, global CDN, preview deployments
- **Render**: Simple deployment, good for Python apps, automatic scaling
- **Neon**: Serverless PostgreSQL, excellent developer experience
- **Upstash**: Serverless Redis, pay-per-use pricing

**Alternatives Considered**:
- **AWS/GCP/Azure**: More control but complex setup and higher costs
- **Railway/Fly.io**: Good alternatives but Render more stable
- **Self-hosted**: Maximum control but significant operational overhead

### Development Tools

#### Monorepo Management
**Chosen**: pnpm workspaces + Turbo

**Rationale**:
- **pnpm**: Faster installs, better disk usage than npm/yarn
- **Turbo**: Excellent caching and parallel execution
- **TypeScript**: Shared packages with proper type checking

#### Code Quality
**Chosen**: 
- **Frontend**: ESLint + Prettier + TypeScript
- **Backend**: Ruff + Black + mypy + pytest

**Rationale**:
- **Consistency**: Automated formatting and linting
- **Type Safety**: Comprehensive type checking
- **Testing**: Industry standard testing frameworks

#### CI/CD
**Chosen**: GitHub Actions

**Rationale**:
- **Integration**: Native GitHub integration
- **Cost**: Free for public repos, reasonable for private
- **Ecosystem**: Excellent action marketplace

## Architecture Principles

### Security First
- All data encrypted in transit and at rest
- Comprehensive audit logging
- Regular security updates and patches
- HIPAA compliance from day one

### API-First Design
- Frontend consumes same APIs as external integrations
- OpenAPI documentation auto-generated
- Versioned APIs for backward compatibility

### Microservices-Ready Monolith
- Clear service boundaries within monorepo
- Separate concerns (web, api, worker)
- Easy to extract services later if needed

### Developer Experience
- Fast feedback loops with hot reload
- Comprehensive type safety
- Clear error messages and debugging

### Observability
- Structured logging throughout
- Health checks for all services
- Performance monitoring and alerting
