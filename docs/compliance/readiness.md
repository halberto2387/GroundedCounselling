# HIPAA Compliance and Security Readiness

GroundedCounselling is designed with healthcare compliance in mind, particularly HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) requirements for protecting patient health information.

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the security measures, compliance framework, and risk management strategies implemented in the GroundedCounselling platform to ensure the protection of Protected Health Information (PHI) and compliance with relevant healthcare regulations.

## Regulatory Framework

### HIPAA Compliance

#### Covered Entities and Business Associates
- **Platform Role**: Business Associate to healthcare providers
- **Business Associate Agreements (BAAs)**: Required with all service providers
- **Covered Entity Support**: Tools and features to help providers maintain compliance

#### Required Safeguards

**Administrative Safeguards**
- ✅ Security Officer designation
- ✅ Workforce training programs
- ✅ Access management procedures
- ✅ Incident response procedures
- ✅ Audit controls and monitoring

**Physical Safeguards**
- ✅ Facility access controls (cloud infrastructure)
- ✅ Workstation use controls
- ✅ Device and media controls

## Technical Security Measures

### Data Encryption

#### Encryption at Rest
```typescript
// Database encryption
- AES-256 encryption for database storage
- Encrypted file systems for all data storage
- Encrypted backups with separate key management

// Application-level encryption for sensitive fields
class PHIField {
  @Encrypt()
  private sensitiveData: string;
  
  @Encrypt() 
  private medicalNotes: string;
}
```

#### Encryption in Transit
- TLS 1.3 for all HTTPS connections
- End-to-end encryption for video sessions
- Encrypted API communications
- Secure WebSocket connections

### Authentication and Authorization

#### Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
```typescript
// 2FA implementation ready
interface User {
  is2faEnabled: boolean;
  totpSecret?: string;
}

// TOTP verification
function verifyTOTP(secret: string, token: string): boolean {
  // Implementation for time-based OTP verification
}
```

#### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
```typescript
enum UserRole {
  PATIENT = "patient",
  COUNSELLOR = "counsellor", 
  ADMIN = "admin",
  SUPER_ADMIN = "super_admin"
}

// Permission checks
function requirePermission(permission: Permission) {
  return (req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) => {
    if (!hasPermission(req.user.role, permission)) {
      throw new ForbiddenError("Insufficient permissions");
    }
    next();
  };
}
```

### Audit Logging

#### Comprehensive Activity Tracking
```sql
-- Audit log table structure
CREATE TABLE audit_logs (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
    action VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    resource_type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    resource_id VARCHAR(100),
    ip_address INET,
    user_agent TEXT,
    old_values JSONB,
    new_values JSONB,
    metadata JSONB,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

#### Logged Activities
- User authentication events
- Data access and modifications
- Administrative actions
- System configuration changes
- Failed access attempts
- Data exports and reports

### Data Integrity

#### Database Integrity
- ACID transactions for all critical operations
- Foreign key constraints
- Check constraints for data validation
- Regular integrity checks

#### Application Integrity
```typescript
// Data validation with Pydantic
class PatientRecord(BaseModel):
    first_name: str = Field(..., min_length=1, max_length=100)
    last_name: str = Field(..., min_length=1, max_length=100)
    date_of_birth: date
    
    @validator('date_of_birth')
    def validate_age(cls, v):
        if v > date.today():
            raise ValueError('Date of birth cannot be in the future')
        return v
```

## Risk Assessment and Threat Modeling

### Identified Threats

#### Data Breach Risks
- **Threat**: Unauthorized access to PHI
- **Mitigation**: Multi-layer authentication, encryption, access controls
- **Monitoring**: Real-time intrusion detection, audit logging

#### System Availability Risks
- **Threat**: Service disruption affecting patient care
- **Mitigation**: High availability architecture, redundancy, monitoring
- **Recovery**: Disaster recovery procedures, backup systems

#### Insider Threats
- **Threat**: Unauthorized access by employees/contractors
- **Mitigation**: Principle of least privilege, background checks, monitoring
- **Detection**: Anomaly detection, audit trail analysis

#### Third-Party Risks
- **Threat**: Vendor security vulnerabilities
- **Mitigation**: BAAs, security assessments, monitoring
- **Controls**: Regular security reviews, incident response coordination

### Risk Mitigation Strategies

#### Technical Controls
```typescript
// Rate limiting to prevent abuse
@RateLimit({ requests: 100, window: '15m' })
@Route('POST', '/api/v1/auth/login')
async function login(req: Request) {
  // Login implementation with rate limiting
}

// Input validation to prevent injection attacks
@ValidateInput(LoginSchema)
async function authenticate(credentials: LoginCredentials) {
  // Secure authentication logic
}
```

#### Administrative Controls
- Security awareness training
- Access review procedures
- Incident response team
- Vendor management program

#### Physical Controls
- Secure cloud infrastructure
- Data center physical security
- Device management policies
- Secure disposal procedures

## Data Governance

### Data Classification

  timestamp: Date;
  ipAddress: string;
}

// Minimal data collection principle
class UserRegistration {
  requiredFields = ['email', 'firstName', 'lastName'];
  optionalFields = ['phone', 'dateOfBirth'];
}
```

#### Data Retention
```sql
-- Automated data retention policies
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION cleanup_old_audit_logs()
RETURNS void AS $$
BEGIN
    -- Retain audit logs for 7 years per HIPAA requirements
    DELETE FROM audit_logs 
    WHERE created_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '7 years';
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

#### Data Disposal
